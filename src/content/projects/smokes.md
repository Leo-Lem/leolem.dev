Smokes is an iOS application designed to help users track their smoking habits by visualizing statistics and providing insights for behavioral improvement. The app offers a user-friendly interface, detailed analytics, and customization options to support users in monitoring and reducing their smoking habits.

### My Contributions

Designed and developed the app using Swift and SwiftUI, ensuring a seamless, intuitive user experience. Built the backend infrastructure to handle user data and statistics securely. Implemented key features such as habit tracking, data visualization, and analytics. Utilized CI/CD pipelines and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for efficient deployment and scalability. Managed the app's release on the App Store, including licensing and compliance.
