The Sustainable IT Dashboard is a cloud-native solution designed to monitor and improve sustainability metrics for IT systems. It provides real-time insights into energy usage and environmental impact, supporting organizations in achieving their sustainability goals.

### My Contributions

Led the development of the dashboard's backend using Java and Quarkus, integrating PostgreSQL for efficient data management. Built and optimized the infrastructure using Kubernetes, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to ensure scalability and reliability. Implemented monitoring solutions with Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and sustainability metrics. Streamlined development processes through GitLab CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth deployment and team collaboration. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design a user-centric interface and align development goals with sustainability objectives.
